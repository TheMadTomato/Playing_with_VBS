# Why VBS

while it is used that much anymore it is fun to work with, and it still can do some decent automation in the present time.
Plus, it is fun to use to iritate teachers at schools and uni :v

so ye while i do not see myself using VBS professionaly, I still want to learn it for the sake of fun. Who knows maybe in the future i would be in an adminstrative position where i might use vbs to automate som suff.

But for now it is my little game that i let steam off with.
